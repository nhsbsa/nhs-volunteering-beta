      </h1>

      <p>You can use this service if you want to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>advertise your opportunities and receive applications though NHS Volunteering</li>
        <li>advertise your opportunities and link to application forms on existing systems</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">You can advertise either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>one or more specific opportunities</li>
        <li>a generic listing for all your opportunities</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
        <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">We refer to 'specific opportunity' to describe an opportunity with a defined title, requirements and responsibilities.</p>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">A 'generic opportunity' is a broader listing that doesn't provide as much detail and it can include a range of opportunities.</p>
      </div>


      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">The process</h2>

      <p>The information you enter will create a listing that potential volunteers will see when they search for an opportunity.</p>
      
      <p>To complete a listing, you will need to complete the following sections:</p>

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">1. add a preview </h2>

    <p>This is what potential volunteers will see first when they search for opportunities.</p>

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">2. fill in the listing</h2>

    <p>You will add:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>a summary</li>
    <li>details of the type of person you are looking for</li>
    <li>an overview of your application process</li>
    <li>the availability you need</li>
    <li>the contact details where you want to receive queries about the opportunity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">3. add locations</h2>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">You can add one or more locations for the opportunity. This will allow potential volunteers can find opportunities that are closest to them.</p>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">You will also be able to select if this is a remote opportunity.</p>

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">4. select the application settings</h2>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">You can decide if you want to receive applications through this service or through an external link.</p>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">You will set a closing date for this listing.</p>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">If you receive applications through this service, you can also set a limit to the number of applications.</p>

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Reviewing and making changes</h2>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">You can save your progress and continue once you have entered a title.</p>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">You can also preview the listing before publishing.</p>

     <p class="nhsuk-body">Once you publish the listing, you can still change the closing date and the number of applications you want to receive.</p>

    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Guidance </h2>

    <p class="nhsuk-body">We have added examples and guidance to support you through each step of this task.</p>
